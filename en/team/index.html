What started with endless 'why' questions has grown into a career where he translates complex technical challenges into clear, actionable solutions. With a background in Industrial Design Engineering from TU Delft and a Master's in Product Management and Product Marketing, Maarten has over 15 years of experience in product development and innovation.<br><br>Since 2007, he has helped numerous companies quickly bring innovative solutions to market. His unique strength lies in combining two seemingly opposing worlds: the strategic, process-driven side of product management, where he has built profitable products and companies in roles like Head of Product at EMS and CPO at Infinic, and the creative, technical work as a product engineer. Whether it‚Äôs 3D printing, CNC milling, sheet metal, or injection molding for larger industrial processes, Maarten is always quick to set up tangible experiments to gain real insights early in the development process.<br><br>Although he doesn‚Äôt call himself an ‚Äòinventor,‚Äô he wouldn‚Äôt mind the title one day (maybe). Entrepreneurial and always solution-focused, he knows how to get things done‚Äîwhether in large corporations or in his own workshop.</p></div></div><div class="mt-5 text-right title bg-gradient-to-r from-red-600 to-yellow-500 text-transparent bg-clip-text"> Bas </div><div class="paragraph flex flex-col flex-col-reverse justify-end sm:flex-row"><div class="sm:w-2/3"><p class="mt-3 sm:mt-0">From an early age, Bas mastered the computer. Instead of playing games, he began building his first websites and Windows desktop applications in the 1990s. After earning a Master's in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology, he spent around ten years as a consultant in software and data engineering, working at companies like Xebia, GoDataDriven, and Capgemini.<br><br>Bas is a creative, pragmatic, and buzzword-averse technologist with over 25 years of experience in frontend, backend, cloud, and data engineering. His strength lies in designing and building simple, user-friendly, and maintainable products. By listening carefully, he quickly gets to the essence of a problem, while also being confidently independent, ready to think outside the box when necessary. He leads teams by fostering growth in others, sharing his knowledge and thought processes.<br><br>His creativity also shines through in his own <a target="_blank" href="https://basbeelen.com">piano compositions</a> and delicious homemade wood-fired pizzas.</p></div><div class="sm:w-1/3"><img src="/assets/bas-CpTiXzsI.png" class="w-full sm:ml-5"></div></div></div></div><div class="fixed cookie bg-red-700 w-full flex-col fixed text-white h-28 flex items-center justify-center"><div class="text-center">This website uses cookies for analytical purposes</div><div class="flex mt-2"><button class="bg-white rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-black">Manage</button><button class="bg-white rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-black mx-2">Accept</button></div></div></div></div>
